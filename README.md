# iOi-Hackathon
Held on 8/28-8/29 at Bespoke, San Francisco, CA 94103.

Description
On August 28th and 29th, 2018, teams from around the country will be meeting in San Francisco at NAR’s first iOi Hackathon to determine how artificial intelligence and machine learning impact the future of real estate. Teams can start building their ideas on August 1, and will present them as part of the iOi Summit on August 29th. It is imperative that all participants in the hackathon adhere to our Code of Conduct, which can be found here.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning are already impacting real estate. From chatbots to natural language processing to predictive search, products are evolving. What is possible outside these realms? This hackathon aims to find new and novel approaches to how artificial intelligence and machine learning will impact real estate. Some example problems to explore:
How can we improve the ways in which agents serve their clients?
What are the opportunities for improving home search in the real estate industry?
How can agents maximize their marketing opportunities with less effort and without opening themselves up to legal issues?
How will data display be impacted by these technologies?
We aim to think deeply in this hackathon about these problems and how AI/ML can be applied to solve them. For more information about the hackathon, please view our full rules, guidelines, terms, and conditions.
